        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
          Perspective Design was founded by Peter Bain and George Slomp in 2016.
          Both of them had been working independently as contractors and were
          ready to start some thing new, something bigger. Merging their two
          companies, they each both brought to the business their own expertise,
          experience, clients, contacts, and contractors, which makes the
          company richer, deeper, and more solid. George and Peter have built
          the Perspective Team upon a foundation of working in this field, in
          the Valley for almost 10 years each. Perspective Design Build is about
          good quality people who do good quality work.
